		# XML Parser for OCR Scanned Case Files

		*Author: Garrett Myers*

		## Usage

		### ROUTE: /

		Returns a read me for the API, along with the API documentation.

		### ROUTE: /cases

		Returns a list of cases and their data.

		### ROUTE: /cases/casename

		Get cases by name.

		The desired case should be placed into the url as follows:

		ex. cases/TestCase

		Cases are *not* unique. The get request may return multiple cases.

		### ROUTE: /cases/new

		Allows a user to upload a new case file to be parsed.

		The post uses HTML form-data. Please provide the following inputs:

		*casefile*: An **XML** file created by OCR scan of a case document.
		*casename*: Name for the case to be referenced by.

		The server will attempt to extract the plaintiff and defendant of the case from the XML file. It assumes a generic format of something like the following:

		...............
		COURT OF ......
		*PLAINTIFF*....
		V(S). .........
		*DEFENDANT*....
		DEFENDANT, ....

		As such, depending on the OCR, extraneous data may be present in the results.

		Upon success, the user is redirected to a get request for 'cases/casename'
